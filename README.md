# Module 7 Lab Guide (part 2)

## Lab Activity 2 - NumberCounter
### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range 0 to 50 inclusive and counts how many occurrences of each are entered. After all input has been processed, print all of the values (with the number of occurrences) that were entered one or more times. User input must be validated and invalid input should be handled gracefully.

### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A1-NumberCounter and create a new file named NumberCounter.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirement in the Problem Description and enter the program code in NumberCounter.java
3. Test the program and pay particular attention to boundary/edge cases and invalid input.
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 1 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Lab Activity 3 - NumberStats
### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that creates a histogram that allows you to visually inspect the frequency distribution of a set of values. The program should read in an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive; then it should produce a chart similar to the following on that indicates how many input values fell in the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and so on. Print one asterisk for each value entered.

     1 - 10   | *****  
    11 - 20   | **  
    21 - 30   | *************************  
    31 - 40   |   
    41 - 50   | ***  
    51 - 60   | *******  
    61 - 70   | **  
    71 - 80   | *****  
    81 - 90   | *******  
    91 - 100  | *********  

### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named A2-NumberStats and create a new file named NumberStats.java
2. Design a program to satisfy the requirements in the Problem Description and enter the program code in NumberStats.java
3. Test the program and pay particular attention to boundary/edge cases and invalid input.
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 2 is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
